# Password-Protector--for-personal-home-use-

Requires [pyCryptodome](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome) to be installed before use.

A simple script that will save passwords that you type in and encrypt them into a file that can be retrieved later using your master key (user choose at the moment)

As of right now it only saves one password and decrpyts that same password. Any other passwords that get entered overwrite the file. This will be fixed in future versions.
